# Volunteers

Student Robotics would not be able to deliver on its mission without its volunteers. They invest vast quantities of time and effort to make Student Robotics the success that it is. Within Student Robotics a volunteer is defined as an individual who has registered as such.

The register of volunteers is maintained, by the Trustees, on the Google GSuite organisation for Student Robotics and reviewed every 18 months. If a volunteer indicates that they are no longer interested in being a volunteer when the register is reviewed, or does not respond during the review, their personal account will be suspended and, after 3 months, deleted. The following information, as a minimum, is recorded for each volunteer:

* Name \(first name and surname\)
* Email \(alternative email to that issued by SR\)
* Mobile Phone Number
* Geographical Location \(i.e. City/Town\)

Each volunteer is required to abide by the  [code of conduct ](code-of-conduct.md) and to observe  [safe guarding policy](safeguarding.md).
