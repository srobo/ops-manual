# Volunteers

Student Robotics would not be able to deliver on its mission without its volunteers. They invest vast quantities of time and effort to make Student Robotics the success that it is. Within Student Robotics a volunteer is defined as an individual who has registered as such.

The register of volunteers is maintained, by the Trustees, on the Google GSuite organisation for Student Robotics and reviewed every 18 months. If a volunteer indicates that they are no longer interested in being a volunteer when the register is reviewed, or does not respond during the review, their personal account will be suspended and, after 3 months, deleted. The following information, as a minimum, is recorded for each volunteer:

* Name \(first name and surname\)
* Email \(alternative email to that issued by SR\)
* Mobile Phone Number
* Geographical Location \(i.e. City/Town\)

Each volunteer is required to abide by the  [code of conduct ](code-of-conduct.md) and to observe  [safe guarding policy](safeguarding.md). 

# Members

Volunteers may choose to become a "Member" of the charity. This has no impact on their ability to volunteer for Student Robotics, but creates an opportunity for them to have more of a say in the long term direction of the charity. The role of a member is defined in the [constitution](../resources/constitution.pdf). Members must be approved by the trustees.

If a volunteer wishes to become a member of the charity, they should e-mail the trustees with the following details:

* Name \(first name and surname\)
* Email \(alternative email to that issued by SR\)
* Home address

# Trustees

All volunteers are overseen by the Trustees. The role of the trustees is defined in the [constitution](../resources/constitution.pdf).
