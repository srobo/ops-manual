# Code of Conduct

### 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Student Robotics is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion \(or lack thereof\).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, including, but not limited to, volunteers, competitors and team leaders. It further outlines the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We invite all those who participate in Student Robotics to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

### 2. Open source citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

### 3. Expected behaviour

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

### 4. Unacceptable behaviour

The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information \("doxing"\).
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following \(online or in person\).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

### 5. Consequences of unacceptable behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

### 6. Reporting guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify the Trustees as soon as possible via [trustees@studentrobotics.org](mailto:trustees@studentrobotics.org). All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

* Your contact information.
* Names \(real, nicknames, or pseudonyms\) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record \(e.g. Slack or GitHub discussion\), please include a link.
* Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a Trustee will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and the Trustees will make a decision as to how to respond. If a report is raised against a Trustee, they will be recused from handling the incident. All reports will be treated in confidence. 

### 7. Addressing grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the Trustees with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

### 8. Scope

This code of conduct applies to all those who participate in our community, including, but not limited to, volunteers, competitors, team supervisors, and other guests. 

We expect all participants to abide by this Code of Conduct in all venues – online and in-person – as well as in all communications pertaining to SR business. This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of SR activities when such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of SR participants.
