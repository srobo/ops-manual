# Members

Volunteers may choose to become a "Member" of the charity. This has no impact on their ability to volunteer for Student Robotics, but creates an opportunity for them to have more of a say in the long term direction of the charity. The role of a member is defined in the [constitution](../resources/constitution.pdf). Members must be approved by the trustees.

If a volunteer wishes to become a member of the charity, they should e-mail the trustees with the following details:

* Name \(first name and surname\)
* Email \(alternative email to that issued by SR\)
* Home address

The register of members is available for inspection by pplication to the trustees.
