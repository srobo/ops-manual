# Introduction

This manual serves as the primary way for the Student Robotics Trustees to define what Student Robotics is, what it stands for and how it operates. It is not intended as a detailed prescriptive manual of how each activity within the organisation is carried out, but rather as a means to set the foundations upon which the organisation is built.

The latest version is always available to read at [https://srobo.gitbook.io/ops-manual/](https://srobo.gitbook.io/ops-manual/). The source of this document is available at [https://github.com/srobo/ops-manual](https://github.com/srobo/ops-manual). Please note that information contained on the 'master' branch of the repository \(the 'In Development' version of the GitBook\) has not yet been released and is therefore not authoritative.
