# Volunteers

Student Robotics would never be able to deliver on its mission without its volunteers. They invest vast quantities of time and effort to make Student Robotics the success that it is. Within Student Robotics a volunteer is defined as an individual who has registered as such.

The register of volunteers is maintained by the Trustees and reviewed every 18 months. If a volunteer indicates that they are no longer interested in being a volunteer when the register is reviewed, or does not respond during the review, their personal details will be deleted. The following information, as a minimum, is recorded for each volunteer:

* Name
* Email Address
* Phone Number
* Postal Address
* Emergency Contact Details \(name, email and phone number of emergency contact\)
