# Annual Robotics Competition

The Student Robotics Competition Program is the main activity of Student Robotics and is how it currently meets its charitable objective set out in its [constitution](../resources/constitution.pdf). It consists of an annual program, aligned with the academic year, where teams of 16-19 year-olds \(generally in sixth form\) partake in an reasonably open-ended engineering challenge to construct autonomous robots. The planning, management and running of the Competition Program is the responsibility of the Core Team and it is up to the Core Team \(with guidance from the Trustees\) to define what the program will be for a given annual cycle.
