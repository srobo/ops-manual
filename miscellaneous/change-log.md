# Change Log

All notable changes to the Operations Manual will be documented on this page.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog v1.0.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) \(see the [Release Versioning](release-versioning.md) page for details of what this means\).

Each release of the Operations Manual has an entry on this page. Within this entry changes are broken down into 'Added', 'Changed', 'Removed' and 'Minor Fix'. The first three categories cover modifications that affect the function of the document, whereas the last one includes modifications that do not, for example corrections to typos and formatting. Each entry also includes the date on which it took effect.

* Clarification to [Safeguarding](../about-the-charity/safeguarding.md) that it is only young people who are participating in Student Robotics activities that volunteers must not meet outside of the supervised environment.

* Instructions to [Reporting Guidelines](../about-the-charity/code-of-conduct.md#6-reporting-guidelines) in Code of Conduct detailing what information to include in a report, how the report is handled and how corner cases, such as the person being accused being one of the people who normally deals with reports, are dealt with.
* Clarification to [Core Team's Expectations of the Trustees](https://github.com/srobo/ops-manual/tree/d9e76a35317e628b18897f068a9332d47488e80d/annual-robotics-competition/core-team.md#core-teams-expectations-of-the-trustees) number 6 that only Trustees have direct access to volunteer dataset and that the Core Team will have to work with the Trustees to make use of it.

* Reference to not giving refunds to paid events from [Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour](../about-the-charity/code-of-conduct.md#5-consequences-of-unacceptable-behaviour) section of Code of Conduct. We don't run paid events, so it isn't relevant.

### Minor Fix

* Make release procedure in [Making Changes to this Document](./#making-changes-to-this-document) section into a numbered list.
* Make points under [Trustees' Expectations of the Core Team](https://github.com/srobo/ops-manual/tree/d9e76a35317e628b18897f068a9332d47488e80d/annual-robotics-competition/core-team.md#trustees-expectations-of-the-core-team) number 8 \(be self-organising\) into a numbered list.

## Version 3 \(2018-07-09\)

The whole Operations Manual has been completely rewritten and bears little resemblance to Version 2, therefore it would not be sensible to try and enumerate all of the changes. Version 3 effectively represents a completely new direction for the Operations Manual and should be viewed as a completely new work.
