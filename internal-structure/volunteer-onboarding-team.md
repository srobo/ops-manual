# Volunteer Onboarding Team

## Purpose

The volunteer onboarding team are responsible for looking after new volunteers in their first 12 months of volunteering with SR.  

Their work includes, but is not limited to:

* devising and documenting an induction programme for new volunteers
* responding to anyone who expresses an interest in volunteering with SR
* ensuring that new volunteers are appropriately inducted
* checking in with new volunteers on a regular basis


[The way that the team is structured and operates](team-operations.md) is consistent with all of the other SR teams.
