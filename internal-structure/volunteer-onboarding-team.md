# Volunteer Onboarding Team

## Purpose

The volunteer onboarding team are responsible for looking after new volunteers in their first 12 months of volunteering with SR.  

They are responsible for:

* responding to anyone who expresses an interest in volunteering with SR
* ensuring that new volunteers are appropriately inducted
* checking in with new volunteers on a regular basis
* devising and documenting an induction programme for new volunteers

## Structure and Operation

The volunteer onboarding team is a group of volunteers who work together, and closely with other teams within SR, to support new volunteers. The team is lead by a committee that is responsible for fulfilling the aims of the team.

The team (and its committee) operates on a 24-month cycle (see [Formation and Dissolution](committee-membership.md)).

Volunteers apply through the committee to join the team. The committee will ensure the team has an appropriate balance of relevant skills. Volunteers will be encouraged to apply at the start of each competition cycle but can apply at any time. The committee should not unreasonably restrict membership of the team.

## The Committee

The Committee is a group of three people who are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the work of the team is carried out in the manner expected by the Trustees, coherent with the values of Student Robotics. The committee is accountable to the Trustees.

The committee will focus on management of time, resources and volunteers within the team. The committee will provide support and guidance to team members to allow them to be as effective as possible in delivering the infrastructure services. The Trustees will provide support, guidance and training as necessary to allow the committee to be as effective as possible in managing the team.

## Roles and Responsibilities

In addition to the [common responsibilities](common-responsibilities.md), the marketing team has the following responsibilities:

* responding to anyone who expresses an interest in volunteering with SR
* ensuring that new volunteers are appropriately inducted
* checking in with new volunteers on a regular basis
* devising and documenting an induction programme for new volunteers

## Accountability

The volunteer onboarding team is accountable to the Trustees. The committee member responsible for reporting to the Trustees will speak in person with the Trustees at least once every month to report on progress and to highlight any areas of concern.

Minutes of meetings should be made available to the general public, although access to any sensitive commercial data may be restricted to the Trustees.

## Budget

A budget will be made available to support the work of the team. The responsibility for this budget will be delegated to an individual committee member.
