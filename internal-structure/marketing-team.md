## Structure and Operation

The team (and its committee) operates on a 24-month cycle (see [Formation and Dissolution](committee-membership.md)).

Volunteers apply through the Marketing Team Committee to join the team. The committee will ensure the team has an appropriate balance of relevant skills. Volunteers will be encouraged to apply at the start of each competition cycle but can apply at any time. The committee should not unreasonably restrict membership of the team.

## The Committee

The Committee is a group of three people who are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the work of the team is carried out in the manner expected by the Trustees, coherent with the values of Student Robotics. 

The committee will focus on management of time, resources and volunteers within the team. The committee will provide support and guidance to team members to allow them to be as effective as possible in delivering the infrastructure services.

Minutes of meetings should be made available to the general public, although access to any sensitive commercial data may be restricted to the Trustees.

## Budget

A budget will be made available to support the work of the team. The responsibility for this budget will be delegated to an individual committee member.
