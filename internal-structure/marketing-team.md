## Structure and Operation

The Marketing Team is a group of volunteers who work together, and closely with other teams within SR, to attract competitors and volunteers into SR. The team is lead by a committee that is responsible for fulfilling the aims of the team.

The team (and its committee) operates on an 11-month cycle (see [Formation and Dissolution](committee-membership.md)).

Volunteers apply through the Marketing Team Committee to join the team. The committee will ensure the team has an appropriate balance of relevant skills. Volunteers will be encouraged to apply at the start of each competition cycle but can apply at any stage of the competition cycle. The committee should not unreasonably restrict membership of the team.

## The Committee

The Committee is a group of 3 people who are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the teams are sourced in the manner expected by the Trustees, coherent with the values of Student Robotics. The committee is accountable to the Trustees.

The committee will focus on management of time, resources and volunteers within the team. The committee will provide support and guidance to team members to allow them to be as effective as possible in delivering the infrastructure services. The Trustees will provide support, guidance and training as necessary to allow the committee to be as effective as possible in managing the team.
