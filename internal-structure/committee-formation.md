# Committee formation and dissolution

### Committee cycles

The **competition team** and its committee operates on an 12-month cycle running from the beginning of July to the end of June the following year.

All **other committees** operate on a 24-month cycle running from the beginning of July in year one to the end of June in year three. 

### Dissolution

At the end of the term of office, each committee is invited to meet with the Trustees to review the progress made. This serves as a useful event for both the committee, to reflect on their achievements, and the Trustees, to gather as much information as possible to feed into the new cycle. It is expected that the committee will get the views of the wider team before the meeting. After the review meeting, the team and its committee is stood down. 

The dissolution of the team allows other volunteers a chance to stand for the committee. This is healthy for the organsiation and ensures that it is not over-dependednt on a small set of volunteers. There should be no expectation that committee members will be reappointed at the end of their term of office and nothing should be read into the fact that one or more members are not reappointed. The trustees will always take the long term view. 

### Eligibility

All registered volunteers who have participated in at least one full (11-month) competition cycle, including volunteering at the main competition event, are invited to express an interest in a place on a committee. Committee members are selected from applicants who have relevant skills and experience. Preference is gven to volunteers who have actively particpated in the work of the relevant team. 

### Registration of Interest

Approximately three weeks before the new committee is to be formed, eligible volunteers (including previous members of the committee) are invited to express an interest in being part of the next committee.  

### Supporting information

The Trustees discuss their expectations for the coming cycle (based on feedback from the previous cycle) and decide on the direction in which they would like the work of the teams to be taken and where they would like the new committee to focus their efforts. For example, it may be the case that the Trustees would like to increase the number of kits available, expand the number of female participants, or they may want a focus on increasing volunteer engagement. This information is communicated to applicants who will be invited to provide additional information in support of their application.

### Formation

Each committee is formed, following a meeting of the Trustees. Prior to this, applications from all eligible applicants are carefully considered and meetings with individual applicants may be held.  The Trustees select a set of volunteers that they feel are most able to take on the responsibilities of the committee and will work well together. The trustees will seek to give volunteers the opportunity to work in new areas and to acquire new skills so long as the stability of the organsaition is maintained. 



### Insufficient applications

The ideal size of a committee is three members. This allows a spread of responsibilities and for effective debate. If there are insufficient suitable applicants, the Trustees appoint a smaller commitee and work with that commitee to find suitable candidates for the unfilled position(s).  

### Resignation of a committee member

If a committee member wishes to resign part-way through their term of office they email the Trustees. The Trustees work with the individual to see if there is any further help and support that they can provide to allow the volunteer to continue in their role. If there is no option for the individual to continue, the Trustees work with the rest of the committee to find a suitable candidate for the role.
