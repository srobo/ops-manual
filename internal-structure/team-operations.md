# Team structure and operation

The competition team and its committee operates on an 11-month cycle running from early July to early June the following year. All other committees operate on a 23-month cycle running from early July in year one to early June in year three. The process for committee [Formation and Dissolution](committee-formation.md)).

Volunteers apply to join the team through its committee. Volunteers will be encouraged to apply at the start of each competition cycle but can apply at any time. The committee should not unreasonably restrict membership of the team.

## Committees

A committee is a group of three people who are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the work of the team is carried out in the manner expected by the Trustees, coherent with the values of Student Robotics. Each committee is accountable to the Trustees. 

A committee will focus on management of time, resources and volunteers within the team. It will ensure the team has an appropriate balance of relevant skills and will provide support and guidance to team members to allow them to be as effective as possible in delivering the work of the team.

Each committee's responsibilities are defined in the list of [common responsibilities](common-responsibilities.md). 

## Team meetings and documentation

A committee is responsible for organising and running team meetings. These will be published in the SR Google calendar and should be open for any volunteer to attend. It is up to each committee to determine how minutes are taken, the format of the minutes, and where they are stored but this information must be shared with team members and should be accessible to all of the team. Key decisions must be recorded in the decision log which is shared across the organisation. 

## Allocation of work

A committee is responsible for making sure that work is allocated fairly and that the workload of each team member is monitored. Volunteers must have the opportunity to say "no" to work that they feel unable to do and to alert the committee if they are struggling with their workload. The committee must do their best to make sure that the team has sufficient volunteers to carry out the work of the team. 

## Budget and financial records

A budget will be made available to support the work of the team. One named member of each committee must act as the team treasurer and the responsibility for the budget will be delegated to this committee member. The team treasurer will be able to approve spending within the allocated budget and must ensure that all expenditure is authorised in advance of being incurred and that appropriate records are kept.
