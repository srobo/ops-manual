# Internal structure of the organisation

The Student Robotics Competition Programme is the main activity of Student Robotics and is how it currently meets its charitable objective set out in its [constitution](https://github.com/srobo/ops-manual/tree/d76377192d4c94c4bd4298f0f3954f5d342af24b/resources/constitution.pdf). It consists of an annual programme, aligned with the academic year, where teams of 16-19 year-olds \(generally in sixth form\) take part in an reasonably open-ended engineering challenge to construct autonomous robots.

This section details the organisation of volunteer teams which deliver this programme.

The teams are as follows:

* [Competition team](competition-team.md) responsible for the planning, management and delivery of the competition programme for a given annual cycle.
* [Fundraising team](fundraising-team.md) responsible for seeking new sponsors and managing the relationship with sponsors.
* [Infrastructure team](infrastructure-team.md) responsible for maintaining the software services that support the competition programme. 
* [Kit team](kit-team.md) responsible for developing the robotics kit and providing and supporting kits to allow teams to compete in the competition programme.
* [Marketing team](marketing-team.md) responsible for promoting the organisation to attract new teams, sponsors and volunteers.
* [Volunteer onboarding team](volunteer-onboarding-team.md] responsible for inducting and supporting new volunteers.
