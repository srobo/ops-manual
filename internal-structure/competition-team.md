# Competition Team

## Purpose

The Competition Team is responsible for defining and delivering the SR Competition Programme ('the competition programme') for a single competition cycle (11 months).

The competition programme includes, but is not limited to:

* Working with the [marketing team ](marketing-team.md) to recruit teams from schools and colleges
* Determining a fair method for selecting teams if over subscribed
* Communicating with school/college team leaders throughout
* Liaising with the [kit team](kit-team.md)  to agree the number of teams and number of locations that can be supported
* Devising a challenge
* Organising and running Kickstart
* Organising and running Tech days
* Organising and running the Competition final
* Training sufficient volunteers to support planned events
* Health and Safety and Safeguarding at events
* Gathering metrics throughout the competition cycle

[The way that the team is structured and operates](team-operations.md) is consistent with all of the other SR teams.
