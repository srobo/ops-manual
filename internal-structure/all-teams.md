# Teams

## Structure and operation

Each team (and its committee) operates on a 24-month cycle (see [Formation and Dissolution](committee-membership.md)).

Volunteers apply through the committee to join the team. The committee will ensure the team has an appropriate balance of relevant skills. Volunteers will be encouraged to apply at the start of each competition cycle but can apply at any time. The committee should not unreasonably restrict membership of the team.

## The committee

The committee is a group of three people who are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the work of the team is carried out in the manner expected by the Trustees, coherent with the values of Student Robotics. 

The committee will focus on management of time, resources and volunteers within the team. The committee will provide support and guidance to team members to allow them to be as effective as possible in delivering the work of the team. 

The committee's responsibilities are defined in the list of [common responsibilities](common-responsibilities.md). The committee is accountable to the Trustees. 

## Budget and financial records

A budget will be made available to support the work of the team. One named member of the committee must act as the team treasurer and the responsibility for the budget will be delegated to the this committee member. The team treasurer will be able to approve spending within the approved budget and must ensure that all expenditure is authorised in advance of being incurred and that appropriate records are kept.
