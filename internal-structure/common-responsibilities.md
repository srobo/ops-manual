## Reporting to Trustees
The committee is responsible for ensuring that the team provides regular updates on the work of the team to the Trustees. The committee should also make sure that their team is appropriately represented at the monthly meeting with the Trustees.

## Budgeting
The committee is responsible for drawing up a budget for the following year within the overall budgetary framework provided by the Trustees. The budget must be submitted to the Trustees for approval when requested. The committee must also follow the requirements defined in the Money Matters section (this defines the budgeting requirements in more detail).

## Supporting the recruitment and induction of volunteers
All teams should take an active role in supporting the search for new volunteers and helping with their induction. Committees should make sure that volunteers who express and interest in joing their teams are made welcome and understand how to get invoved with the work of the team.

## Managing relationships
It is important that all volunteers have a positive experience of volunteering with Student Robotics. Committees should work hard to build relationships and to try to tackle any issues that may arise within the team. Relationships with other teams are also important and there should be regular communication between committees. 

## Raisng concenrns with the Trustees
The committee is responsible for ensuring that any concerns raised within their team are raised to the Trustees. If a concern can be handled within the team then a brief summary will suffice, anything that cannot be resolved within the team must be raised to the Trustees ASAP.

## Inter-team communication
The committee is responsible for ensuring they communicate adequately with the other teams. Many teams will be reliant on the other teams for information about what is required, or what can be provided.

## Documenting processes/tools
The team must maintain documentation on what it does and how it operates. This documentation must be available to all in SR.

## Seeking guidance from the Trustees
The team committee is responsible for seeking guidance from the Trustees as to the direction they should take for the coming year.



## Handover
The team committee is responsible for ensuring that there is a clean handover to future committees at the end of their term of office. This does not preclude volunteers being on the committee for consecutive terms.
