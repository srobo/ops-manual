# Common Responsibilities

All committees have the following responsibilities:
* Organising and running team meetings
* Maintaining a log of decsions made
* Reporting to the trustees on progress
* Supporting the recruitment of volunteers
* Budgeting
* Ensuring adequate communication with the other teams
* Documenting their processes/tools
* Raising any concerns and seeking guidance from the trustees
* Ensuring a clean handover with future committees

## Holding meetings
Each team should have regular meetings and the date and time of upcoming meetings should be displayed in the organisation calendar. 

## Maintaining a decision log
All important decisions made by the committee should be logged in a document (stored in the organisation shared drive), listing the following details:
* Date
* Decision
* Reasoning
* Who was present
* Proportion of vote

## Reporting to Trustees
The team committee is responsible for ensuring that the team provides regular updates to the Trustees to keep them in-the-loop with the progress of delivering the competition programme. This is accomplished by arranging for online (Google Hangouts/Meet) calls at least once every month.

## Supporting the recruitment of volunteers
SR wouldn't exist without its volunteers. All teams should take an active role in supporting the search for and helping with the induction of new volunteers.

## Budgeting
The team committee is responsible for drawing up a budget for the following year within the overall budgetary framework provided by the Trustees. They must submit a budget to the Trustees within two months of the formation of the committee. This budget does not need to be extremely detailed; 8-10 budget lines is expected. They must also do the following:
* Keep financial records (in a form to be agreed with the trustees).
* Submit final accounts (at the end of the competition cycle).
* Understand and follow the requirements defined in the Money Matters section (this defines how budgeting works in more detail).

## Inter-team communication
The team committee is responsible for ensuring they communicate adequately with the other teams. Many teams will be reliant on the other teams for information about what is required, or what can be provided.

## Documenting processes/tools
The team must maintain documentation on what it does and how it operates. This documentation must be available to all in SR.

## Raising concerns to the Trustees
The committee is responsible for ensuring that any concerns raised within their team are raised to the Trustees. If a concern can be handled within the team then a brief summary will suffice, anything that cannot be resolved within the team must be raised to the Trustees ASAP.



## Seeking guidance from the Trustees
The team committee is responsible for seeking guidance from the Trustees as to the direction they should take for the coming year.



## Handover
The team committee is responsible for ensuring that there is a clean handover to future committees at the end of their term of office. This does not preclude volunteers being on the committee for consecutive terms.
