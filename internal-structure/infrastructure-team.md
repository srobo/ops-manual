# Infrastructure Team

## Purpose

The Infrastructure Team is responsible for providing and maintaining the computing infrastructure required for the other teams to operate.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Setting up and maintaining servers to support SR operations including the deployment of the public facing web site
* Setting up and maintaining the organisation's domains (studentrobotics.org and srobo.org)
* Maintaining the security of the infrastructure and related services
* Setting up and maintaining the structure of GitHub organisations and permissions
* Setting up and maintaining G-Suite accounts for SR volunteers, teams and committees
* Providing support and guidance with regards to best-practices to other teams or volunteers on infrastructure and services where possible
* Maintaining a list of core services (i.e. services central to Student Robotics operation)
* Maintaining a list of team services (i.e. services maintained especially for and in collaboration with another team)
* Ensuring continuous/enduring access to SR services

* The infrastructure team is **not** responsible for content beyond ensuring it does not break other functionality

 [The way that the team is structured and operates](team-operations.md) is consistent with all of the other SR teams.
