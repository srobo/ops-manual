# Fundraising and Sponsorship Team

## Purpose

The Fundraising and Sponsorship Team is responsible for securing funding for the current and future competition cycles.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Identifying and reaching out to potential sponsors 
* Maintaining a record of contacts and communications
* Managing the relationship with sponsors
* Working with the marketing team to review the effectiveness of sponsorship and fundraising material
* Working closely with the Trustees on all matters relating to sponsors

## Structure and Operation

The Fundraising Team is a group of volunteers who work together, and closely with other teams within SR, to ensure there is sufficient funding for the organisation to fulfill its charitable aims. The team is lead by a committee that is responsible for fulfilling the aims of the team. The team operates continuously (see [Formation and Dissolution](committee-membership.md)).

Volunteers apply through the Fundraising Team Committee to join the team. The committee will ensure the team has an appropriate balance of relevant skills. The committee should not unreasonably restrict membership of the team.

## The Committee

The Committee is a group of three people who are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the work of the team is delivered to the standard expected by the Trustees, coherent with the values of Student Robotics. The committee is accountable to the Trustees and at least one of the Trustees will attend team meetings to make sure that the financial and legal obligations of the Trustees are upheld. 

The committee will focus on management of time, resources and volunteers within the team. The committee will provide support and guidance to team members to allow them to be as effective as possible in attracting and managing sponsorship deals. The Trustees will provide support, guidance and training as necessary to allow the committee to be as effective as possible in managing the team.

## Roles and Responsibilities

In addition to the [common responsibilities](common-responsibilities.md), the committee has the following responsibilities:

### Collective responsibilities

* Negotiating sponsorship deals
* Ensuring all perks due to sponsors are supplied in a timely manner
* Maintaining the relationship with sponsors

## Accountability

The Fundraising and Sponsorship Team is accountable to the Trustees. The Fundraising Team will report the Trustees at least once every month to update them on progress and to highlight any areas of concern.

Due to their commercially sensitive nature, minutes of meetings will not automatically be made available to the general public. Release of this information requires approval of the Trustees.

## Budget

It is not anticipated that this team will need a budget. On formation of a new committee this should be reviewed.
